At this point - let us thank you for all the feedback you all have provided so far. We tried to fix all the bugs you brought up, and we've collected all the feedback into a 'wishlist' with a small amount already making its way into the app this year - and the rest stored safely so we can hopefully make the app even better next year.\n\nWe'll be pushing lots of updates to the stores in the next days, and that means that the version you have on your phone at this instant is not the final one. Please treat this as a friendly reminder to keep your application version up to date and check for updates *often*. There may not be one at all times, but please take the time to check.\n\nThank you for helping us make this app (and convention) awesome! :3"]
