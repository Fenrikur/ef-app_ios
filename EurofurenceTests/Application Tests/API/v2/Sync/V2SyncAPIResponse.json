See your favorites, bid on whatever you like, and buy art for your home!\r\n\r\nA separate registration is needed for bidding to get bid stickers.\r\n\r\nYou will have a final chance at bidding in the Art Show closing. Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Watch the royal tax collectors as they try to \"convince\" the general population to give their share for the pharao's pyramid!\r\n\r\nPlayer selection? In previous years we used to pick players for the show \"on the spot\" by running preliminary games. This year however we decided to try a \"sign up ahead of time\" mode and sent out a mailing to all fursuiters registered.\r\n\r\nWe kept the timeslot and planning for the preliminaries up however, since there might be suiters who just want to goof around anyway, and let's not forget our \"Donation Run\" where participants of the preliminaries could collect money for charity! To include these little games, we decided to have them as an \"open games\" round: basically the same stuff as usual, but with no relevance to the stage show!\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the open round is on Wednesday, ##### 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, #### 12:00-14:30. Both will be at ####!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit.

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

See your favorites, bid on whatever you like, and buy art for your home!\r\n\r\nA separate registration is needed for bidding to get bid stickers.\r\n\r\nYou will have a final chance at bidding in the Art Show closing. Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",
