See your favorites, bid on whatever you like, and buy art for your home!\r\n\r\nA separate registration is needed for bidding to get bid stickers.\r\n\r\nYou will have a final chance at bidding in the Art Show closing. Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

Watch the royal tax collectors as they try to \"convince\" the general population to give their share for the pharao's pyramid!\r\n\r\nPlayer selection? In previous years we used to pick players for the show \"on the spot\" by running preliminary games. This year however we decided to try a \"sign up ahead of time\" mode and sent out a mailing to all fursuiters registered.\r\n\r\nWe kept the timeslot and planning for the preliminaries up however, since there might be suiters who just want to goof around anyway, and let's not forget our \"Donation Run\" where participants of the preliminaries could collect money for charity! To include these little games, we decided to have them as an \"open games\" round: basically the same stuff as usual, but with no relevance to the stage show!\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the open round is on Wednesday, ##### 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, #### 12:00-14:30. Both will be at ####!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit.

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

See your favorites, bid on whatever you like, and buy art for your home!\r\n\r\nA separate registration is needed for bidding to get bid stickers.\r\n\r\nYou will have a final chance at bidding in the Art Show closing. Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\n\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\n\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\n\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!\n\n**Setup times (artists only):**\n  * Wed: 16:00 to 22:00\n  * Thu: 10:00 to 12:00\n\n**Opening times:**\n  * Thu: 12:00 to 20:00 (regular)\n  * Fri: 12:00 to 18:30 (regular)\n\n**Closing:** Fri: 18:30 to 20:30\\\\\n**Art & Charity auction** (Main stage): Sat: 10:30 to 13:00 (seating starts at 10:00)\\\\\n**Art pickup:** Sat: 14:30 to 17:30",

Two years later the studio changed its focus and became an active small creature costuming business. The high quality of the studio's work, as well as the growing customer, base has been the reason Qarrezel's husband, known as LaughingScarab, was asked to join the business as co-owner. \n\nClockwork Creature Studio specializes in realistic, theatrical and macabre costumes. With their stunning costumes they have shown that realism doesn't limit them to depicting only real animals. Instead the studio specialized in realistic fantasy creatures and also made interpretations of mythological creatures found all over the world. To create their costumes the studio uses special techniques for their mold-making and casting processes, which are also used by Hollywood SFX studios. This process makes its possible to create unique masks for each of their clients. Their work features moving parts, unique jaw sets, claws and hooves, which made it necessary to invent new casting and building processes.\n\nFirst shown at Eurofurence 17 in 2011, four of their costumes have been featured in the furry live-action movie Bitter Lake. At Eurofurence 23 you finally have the chance to meet Qarrezel and Velvet from Clockwork Creature Studio during their Meet & Greet. They will talk about their work and are looking forward to having a nice time with you.\nA Fursuit Repair And Maintenance Demonstration will feature a live diagnostic and repair demonstration of several Clockwork Creature costume parts and you can participate in a Q&A about repair and maintenance of specific materials and their issues. During Making Realistic Fursuits they will discuss collecting and using references, designs and much more to achieve a higher level of realism in fursuits.\n\nIf you have ever wondered how to design new characters while considering color theory, and how to use shapes and colors to communicate your idea, join Character And Creature Design hosted by Qarrezel and Kittiara. Bring your own characters to receive feedback and discuss possible changes.",

He started out playing in stairwells, getting chased out of lobbies and playing shows at 08:00 on Sunday for nine people. In the past two years, things have really picked up. Pepper has been playing on stage since then, and if you attend one of his shows, you'll find out why.\n\nKnown mostly for his work with Fox Amoore and Bad Dragon, Pepper released six independent studio albums and worked with artists like Matthew Ebel and Buck of Husky in Denial. Over the years, he released six solo albums under the name Look Left. He performed at around thirty cons with Fox Amoore, and they released an album called Hashtag together.\nWhenever he finds the time for it, Pepper sings at malls and churches around Phoenix, Arizona, where he works as a school teacher.\n\nEurofurence 23 will be Pepper's first appearance in Europe and he is going to make it worth your while. There will be a Meet & Greet, so you have the chance to meet Pepper off stage and talk about his musical career, get things signed by him and just hang out.\n\nHe will be joined by Fox Amoore at the Meet & Greet as well as during two concerts. It will be loud, but not too loud. American, but not too stupid, and funny, but not too funny. Witness Pepper explore the edges of where it's legal to drink in a strange nation during the Open Stage concert! And he promises: there will be howling.\n\nSeriously. Come to a show and see this mess.\n\nBring alcohol.",

Therefore, the charity works actively to educate the local population and in doing so, save many cat lives.\n\nSince they started their charity work, Sieben-Katzenleben e.V. and their colleagues in Spain have made great progress.\\\\\nMany cats have since been rescued from the Perreras, from the streets or from government issued poisoning campaigns.\\\\\nThe animals have received medical treatment, been castrated, chipped and were found new homes with loving, caring owners.\\\\\nThey also offer people affordable castration of their cats and all their hard work is dissolving cat colonies whilst all the animals are being medicated and re-homed.\\\\\n\nThe charity and their Spanish partners built a Finca (animal shelter), a safe haven where the rescued animals are housed and taken care of until they find a new home.\\\\\nThe shelter has eight enclosures and two quarantine stations and there they have managed to save hundreds of cats’ lives.",

For example building a small clinic on the shelter grounds so that animal owners can get their cats castrated for free and get medical treatment for them.\\\\\nThis would further improve the contact with the population and expand the educational work.\\\\\nIn addition, the shelter has expenses for electricity and their heat supply, which currently needs to be expanded considerably so that all enclosures can be heated sufficiently.\\\\\nThe winters in Spain can get really cold!\n\nPlease help us raise money for our dedicated charity, so they can continue their work, save cat lives and improve the general situation for them in Spain.\\\\\nThey are all unpaid volunteers and put all their heart and effort into their work to make a difference for the cats – and so can you!",

It is made to fit the theme of each year. One of the most important tasks is inter-department communication and putting information from various sources together. Further tasks are:\n  * Communication with artists (Art Work)\n  * Communication with other conventions (Advertising)\n  * Creating a design for the current years’ Conbook fitting the theme\n  * Layout the content\n  * 3D-artist to update and adapt the hotel maps\n  * editorial work and proof reading\n\nMain motivation to be in the Conbook department are the lovely team members who are all very passionate about pretty design. Everyone knows the phrase \"No one ever reads the Conbook\"... now we have the vain idea to change a few people’s minds by trying our best every year anew  \n\nWe are always looking for people who are either native to the English language (AE) or very fluent at it to help proofreading the Conbook. Usually proofreading starts in the last week of July. Depending on how quick you are at reading and evaluating mistakes you should plan in at least an hour or two.\n\nIf you want to be a part of the Conbook team, then contact: Snow-wolf via conbook@eurofurence.org.",

Artists for example offer their services with sketches, con badges, little drawings or full coloured artwork, they sell high quality prints, self published comic books and all kind of little things with their art and handwriting on in. Some artists specialized on sewing and costume building offer pre-made costume parts, self made plushies and display their portfolio for commissions later on. Dealers and merchants offer a wide variety of either self made or designed goods like t-shirts, leather crafting, soaps, sweet treats and liqueur, or offer books and plushies from lager brands. The Dealers' Den team itself runs the Eurofurence Shop on site which offers all the leftovers earlier Eurofurences, mostly t-shirts. \n\nThe Dealers' Den also maintains the Artist Alley - a point of sale in the public area where mainly artists have the opportunity to sit down and offer their skills in a more flexible way. Since there is no registration needed the Alley is meant to be an area where artists and customers get together spontaneously - first come, first serve. \n\nThe Dealers' Den Team makes sure that everything from preparations and registration for the Den, the seating situation, to the point of sales itself (including set up and break down of tables and power sockets) works out smoothly for the artists, dealers and customers. We are also the contact persons for the artists and dealers during the convention to all kind of departments like Con Ops and Security if there might be any problems need to be solved. We also host all kind of minor services like a PC with scanner or a get together party for artists, dealers and staff members together with the Art Show Team. \n\n\\\\\nAt the moment the Dealers' Den team is not looking for help, but times are changing, especially at the convention, so don't hesitate to ask if they need help. \n\nThe required time depends on the job you have within the team - most of the work has to be done in advance, like registration forms, seating plans, e-mails, artwork for the conbook and door signs, handouts etc. On site it is about two hours of set up on Wednesday and three for the cleaning on Sunday, or additional Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 11:00 to 19:00 within the Den in the Eurofurence Shop. \n\n\\\\\nIf you want to be a part of the Dealers' Den team, then contact: Alpha_Ki via dealers@eurofurence.org.",

Our goal is to both inform and entertain our readers. Our mission is to go to the most exciting events, talk to the most interesting people and ask the most pressing questions. Also, our best photos since Eurofurence 15 are collected in a permanent archive as a part of Eurofurence's \"visual memory\".\n\nDaily contributors get to meet inspiring people and they get a glimpse behind the scenes of Europe's biggest furry convention. If you are interested in helping, or if you have ideas for articles, please contact our director Luxen.\n\nWe are always looking for writers, editors and photographers. From our team members we expect daily contributions (at least one article or photo job a day) and attendance of our morning meetings. Please be aware that most of the work (writing, editing and processing images) takes place in the evenings. The workload varies between two and six hours a day, but we promise to do our best to make sure that you can still enjoy the convention and that you don't miss your favourite events.  \n\nWe offer a friendly work atmosphere and good learning opportunities for both writers and photographers.\n\nSkills we are looking for:\n  * Good command of English\n  * Some prior experience with writing or editing\n  * Photographers should have a good command of their equipment and editing software\n  * Curiosity and an open mind\n\nSounds good?

Behind the scenes, this requires a lot of planning, preparation, coordination and general \"making the magic work\". Thus there's barely a spot where IT systems don't play a role in the background. While, traditionally, each department builds and operates their own system tailored to their specific needs, more structure and knowledge has become vital over the years.\n\nThe Eurofurence IT department fills this role of a central coordinator and service team for every department that needs IT services before, during or after EF. Among those are the operation of the EF server, which hosts our website including the Daily EF archives, forums, a multitude of internal systems like wiki, etherpad, kanboard, otrs and so on. We help to coordinate the main registration system for EF, for fursuit badges, art show and dealers den. New systems are installed or custom-crafted for special purposes, like an electronic \"stage rider\" for stage events.\n\nOn-site we coordinate with the Estrel IT to get the internet connectivity working; for instance, this included last year's live-stream of our \"big party\" to the outside, running the IT infrastructure like DHCP/DNS, provide hardware (PCs, scanners, switches, etc.) for departments which don't have their own and run our staff wifi.\n\nThe most visible part for attendees is our very own \"Eurofurence app\". It's completely custom-built by us, with a high-performance cloud backend and native on iOS, Android and even Windows Phone. Close cooperation between departments is needed here to get all information from event programming, dealers enlistings, general information and more into the app.\n\nSince our work is so specialized and diverse, we don't usually have open job postings. However, if you're good at IT maintenance, administration and especially programming and would like to help primarily outside the actual convention days, feel free to contact Zefiro. You might soon become part of a ninja team dedicated to keep things running. \n\n\\\\\nIf you want to be a part of the IT team, contact Zefiro via mail or Telegram.",

However most of our tasks have been taken care of month before the convention starts. After introducing Eurofurence to our potential guest, inviting them, and in best case, getting a positive response, rooms and flights need to be booked, events need to planed, information needs to be gathered … all this requires a lot of communication and cooperation with the other departments. In fact, we need to thank all the other departments a lot at this point. Their hard work and dedication makes our job even possible in the first place.  \n\n\\\\\n**Our Motivation**\n\nAfter the convention is before the convention. Being a staff member means for us that, when the mere endless wait for next year’s Eurofurence starts and the PCD hits hard, there is still a bit of Eurofurence going on each week. Weather the regular group chats with the other departments, looking for fitting guests, writing invitations or planning ahead our guests events - it all elevates the mood and never feels like a chore. Having contact with all these creative, nice and amazing people throughout the process is something we would never want to miss. Another great motivation is to get a look behind the scenes. Seeing how the next Eurofurence takes shape, how much work, how many hours of planning and how much creativity is put into everything is a great experience. We are still taking so many things for granted, only to discover later the enormous amount of effort it took to make it run so smoothly. Another enormous motivator is the pride that derives from playing a small role in making the Eurofurence what it is. \n\nPlus, the greatest thing of all is, after greeting a guest arriving at the Estrel, days later at the departure we very often get to say goodbye to a new friend. \n\n\\\\\nIf you want to be a part of the Guest of Honor team, then contact: Arahn via r.burkhardt@weserbild.de.",

Thus - by definition - pictures that are needed during the convention are not part of our responsibilities.\n\nOur department consists of photographers and assistants.\n\nThe photographers:\n  * Share some hours per day on the photo shoot location, using rented equipment.\n  * Take turns covering various events for the media catalogue using their own camera (i.e. a halfway decent DSLR with RAW images is a must-have)\n\nThe assistants:\n  * Help some hours per day on the photo shoot location. This involves handling props, fursuiters and/or operating the registration system computer on location. There will be two assistants in parallel.\n  * If needed, help the photographers at other locations by holding up props, directing people or carrying equipment.\n\nBoth duties involve keeping to a schedule that will be discussed and up for fine tuning within the team as soon as the EF timetable is available, so usually nobody has to miss out on \"must go\" events.\n\nThe fursuit photo shoot might be amongst the more stressful tasks that EF has to offer, but the chance to meet lots of suiters up close and personal makes for a good reward. Also, we try to minimize the hours per day by using enough people to divide the workload.\n\nIf you are interested in helping out, contact Atkelar or ShortyDragon, using photo@eurofurence.org before the convention.\n\nThere are a few prerequisites for helping:\n\nWe might need a few helping hands during setup and tear down of the photo shoot location and the group photo spot that are able to carry some delicate equipment when directed to do so.\n\nFor actual team members...\n\n...the photographers need to:\n  * Have some studio experience (preferably also with fursuiters as subjects)\n  * Have experience with fursuiters (either as spotters or themselves)\n  * Be good at coming up with some funny ideas for poses\n  * Be on time\n\n...the assistants need to:\n  * Have experience with fursuiters (either as spotters or themselves)\n  * Preferably be good at coming up with some funny ideas for poses to help the photographer and suiter in case of a block\n  * Be on time",

Most conventions only are doing \"fursuit games\", which is fun but usually only mildly entertaining to watch. We strive to add some interesting aspects to all games that we are putting on stage. The best ideas however sometimes fail in reality, even after trying them out several times. The show is a \"one-off\" kind of a deal, so we always expect some \"issues\" which require fast troubleshooting capabilities.\n\nWe are usually looking for helpers in the backstage area: moving props on and off stage, getting fursuiters ready for their cue and sometimes helping during a game - as spotters and/or \"living props\", depending on the game.\n\nWe are planning everything out way before the convention and need helpers who will be available online at least some weeks before EF so we can go through the show and games and everybody knows the props, games and can start to learn their cues.

Our mission is to plan, build and operate all Eurofurence stages. Involved in this process are many people and when everything works well you might hardly notice them at all.\n\n**Directors:**\\\\\nJaryic and Kamikaze\n\n**Backoffice and Stage Secretary:**\\\\\nEosFoxx\n\n**Stage Technicians:**\\\\\nBoltee, Djem, Dragi, Furball, garra, Kruemel, Luchs, MafunDi, Reesa, Royen, Sternchen, Tretron, Tsanawo\n\n\\\\\nAs soon as one EF is over, the planning for next one already started. With an after con meeting at the last day we try to improve our work every year. During stage team meetings throughout the year we come up with new ideas and concepts that fit the theme of the upcoming EF. Exchanging knowledge and ideas is vital for this. Assigning tasks and making time schedules is also done during stage meetings.\n\nOperator, Programmer, Event Manager, Stage Manager and Backstage Manager are some of the roles that need to be staffed for every event. You don’t need to have knowledge about stage work to be a part of the stage team, as long as you are eager to learn and get excited about event technology. You do? - Than you are a good fit to work with us.\n\nMost of the stage equipment is supplied by a professional rental company, which we work together with for several years.\n\nThe Main Stage is setup by the rental company. As soon as the setup is finished, our work starts. Programming of light-, laser- and sound-consoles is done by senior team members who are specialized in their departments or work as event technicians. They are assisted and operated by those who want to gather deeper knowledge in the particular field of work.\n\nAt Eurofurence, we host a wide spectrum of stage events. From game-shows to concerts to dances and the well-known Pawpet-Show: Everything is made possible and assisted by the stages team. We connect the artists with technology so they can deliver the best performance possible.\n\n\\\\\nWe are working with professional sound, light and video equipment so here are some basic job requirements:\n  * Good self-assessment\n  * The ability to work under pressure\n  * Punctuality and reliability\n  * Speaking and understanding the German or English language\n\nSounds good? Want to become a part of the team? Then contact garra via stage@eurofurence.org or visit the Main Stage during the Eurofurence and talk to us.",

What sounds easy at first gets more interesting and complex if you understand that it's about coordinating the departments of Eurofurence and attendee panels with their induvial timetables and requirements for resources and rooms.\n\nThat means over 500 hours of scheduled event time in up to 18 parallel events distributed over the whole convention space, and the numbers are growing! While planning this, it's important to take into account what kind of events are running in parallel and allow enough time before and after them. Keeping an eye on the available resources like sound systems and projectors or even people able to operate them add up to it.\n\nMost of our work is done the moment the con starts, but to guarantee a smooth con experience we work closely with Con-Ops and Security while the convention is running. On-site programming is keeping track of the schedule and re-schedules time or location if necessary. We try our best to keep the attendees informed of possible changes and delays by announcing these via our screens, twitter, telegram and the ef-app. To archive that we constantly check back with the other departments too. We also use these channels to pass news from our departments to our attendees. \n\nCommunication is a key. Not only internal, but primarily with interested parties outside. The job demands an organisational talent with an eye for details without losing track of the big picture. \n\nIf you want to be a part of the Programming team, then contact: Akulatraxas via events@eurofurence.org.",

During the convention, our guests can interact with ConOps personally through the Locker-Service (managed by the security team in the previous years) for storage of valuable luggage or the front office which will be at your service for any requests or problems you might encounter. Behind the scenes, we still manage several tasks. We prepare events and panels, setup and breakdown of equipment, transport and acquire additional materials and much more. After the convention is officially over we are still hard at work. After deconstruction and evaluation, we start planning for the next Eurofurence and react on general requests of attendees throughout the whole year.

New members would need to arrive earlier and/or departure later. If you have any experience in logistics it would be appreciated but it’s not mandatory. It is quite possible that you would need to spend a significant amount of time on this task but only before or after the official part of the convention.\n  * On-demand crew: This crew is a quick response team for unforeseen additional tasks during the convention. Additionally, to your will on helping us you would only need the Telegram app on your phone. The time you will spend on these tasks is limited to the tasks you respond to. If you can’t respond to every request that’s no problem.\n  * Room management: This team prepares panel rooms following the event schedule. Different equipment has to be transported to or fetched from the panel rooms. You need to be reliable and on time to prevent any delays in the schedules. Therefor you will work with others in time slot separated schedules. During the convention days, this will take 1-2 hours of your time every day.\n  * Front office: In the front office you have to respond to questions or inquiries of our guests. Therefor you will need to speak English quite fluently. Also, you need to be calm, professional and friendly all the time. The front office team is organized by a schedule that is divided in 2h time slots. You will spend approximately 2 hours a day in the office when you join us, limited to the main con days of course.\n  * Locker-Service: The Locker Service allows our guests to leave their luggage in our hands and we will take good care of it. We are currently transferring this service from the security team to con ops, and are therefore looking to expand our staff to cover our new responsibility. You have to handle these bags, trunks, cameras or cases with great care and reliable. It would be appreciated if you will be able to speak to your customers in English and additional languages. The locker Service is available during its opening hours and during these you will need to spend approximately 1-2 hours a day of your time.\n\nIf you want to join several teams please contact us and we will do our best to find a solution that suits your expectations.",

Adding characters and storyline the show evolved into one of the larger stage events at Eurofurence.\n\n\\\\\n**About us**\n\nIn the beginning it was just a handful of people, today we are a group of more than 30 volunteers working together to create a story-based, drama/action/comedy filled show for mature audiences. Resembling a makers workshop we use our different skills to create puppets, backgrounds, props, special effects, music, script and so on to make this production become reality. Contrary to our beginnings, all of our puppets on stage nowadays are built by our puppet creators, making each of them unique. We share the passion for theatrical productions and some of our goals include a good storyline, convincing characters and situations that astonish the audience.\n\n\\\\\nIf you want to be a part of the Pawpetshow team, the contact: Cheetah via cheetah@tigress.com.",

Over the course of only six months, our team of specialized designers, artists, writers and programmers conjure a design based on the next con's theme and anchored so deeply that even function follows design, appoint an artist and creates the annual, stunning art piece that is first to introduce the topic to public and staff alike, updates and layouts all content and molds everything into code that will not only follow the newest standards, but will also run on all combinations of screens, desktops, phones, operating systems, browsers and configurations possible.\n\nOur job doesn’t end with a static website, too. As the front face of our convention, we also respond on social media, provide an entry-point for all support questions and operate as an interface between our guests, staff, reporters and anyone else interested. We keep all threads together and know our way around. There's no department we don't communicate with and no question we can't answer. Our very few, focused team members don't just do one job. They're all-rounders, and no less is required.\n\nFinding new members is respectively hard for us. We're almost always understaffed and welcome skilled designers and web programmers with open arms. If you consider yourself remotely suitable for either of those two positions and would like to join our squad or take a closer peek into how we work, by all means feel encouraged to give us a shout.\n\nRegardless of whether you're a designer or a programmer, you should know your way around HTML and CSS3 (more so if you're applying as a programmer), you should be able to communicate in English or at least German, and you should be motivated be available all year long, with work density peaking up between August and January. Of course, we're all humans and have our own jobs, lives and vacation.

And while the furry fandom thrives on the wide range of creativity and different art forms; fursuiters are often the most prominent phenomenon on site. These giant fuzzy critters are bringing their anthropomorphic fantasies into the living world.\n\nFursuiting is a whole lot of fun. However, it is also an extremely warm and exhausting thing to do. Imagine, if you will, running around in a thick whole body winter coat in the middle of summer.  - Your vision is limited, your breathing is muffled and your sense of touch is greatly reduced. -  It’s not the most pleasant situation to be in for a long period of time. This said, fursuiters brave these harsh conditions to bring smiles to people, entertain and have fun.\n\n**Here is where the Fursuit-Support-Team comes in.**\n\nWe love to see these critters around as much as possible. And the better we take care of their needs and wellbeing, the more often we get to see them performing. The work we do is unseen by most attendees, but we are there when fursuiters hide from the public eye to break character to recover.\n\nWe get paid in hugs and thank yous from people who can fursuit twice as long now rather than dying of heatstroke or dehydration. Seeing that Eurofurence is praised for its fursuit friendly services and having one of the highest fursuiter quotas of all conventions fills us with great pride.\n\n**So what does the Fursuit-Team actually do?**\n\nBy far our biggest job at the convention is running the “Fursuit Lounge”. A 1000m² hall filled with cooling blower arrays, self-constructed costume drying systems, a fursuit repair center, dozens of drink supply stations and lots of storage space. Once set up, we constantly have to keep all this clean, stocked, and looked after. We are, of course, always there to lend a helping hand, answer questions, check on people’s health, and ensure a fursuiter’s ‘character-privacy’ is respected.\n\nWe also provide these services to panels and events. If a panel or dance involves fursuiters, then we ensure there are wind machines and a backstage area with water and snacks for them.\n\nFursuiters also get their own convention badges that need to be produced and handed out by a whole team of dedicated volunteers.\n\nMany of our tasks may seem menial, such as refilling water, cleaning areas, carrying things around etc. But even these small tasks can mean the world to an exhausted fursuiter who needs nothing more than some fresh air and water.\n\n\\\\\n**Would you like to help?**\n\nEvery year the Fursuit Lounge is among the first permanent service running and is usually the last to close down at the end of the convention. This is a lot of time to cover and a lot of suiters to keep happy. If you would like to join our team and help us keep our fursuiters suiting, here is what we are looking for in a volunteer:\n  * You feel that assisting fursuiters and giving them a safe space is important,\n  * You are willing to help for about an hour per volunteer shift. Preferably more than once during the convention,\n  * You are capable of communicating in basic English,\n  * You can handle heavy water kegs without breaking them or yourself, or know how to use a badge printer to help with the fursuit badges,\n  * And lastly, fursuiters need us the most when they are out having fun and exhausting themselves. We are at our busiest during these times and will need all the help we can get often late into the night to cover the fursuit dances.\n\n\\\\\n**Have questions or want to help?** We would love to hear from you at fursuit-team@eurofurence.org.",

                            "Text": "**A little introduction**\n\nThe media industry is changing fast. Digital technology has dramatically reshaped the news and media industries in the past decade. The growth of social networks, the introduction of smartphones and the evolution of online advertising, have contributed to a brand new media landscape that is changing more and more every day. The internet has not only changed the methods and purpose of journalism, but also people’s perceptions of news media. Firstly, the rise of bloggers and user-based journalism has become immensely popular among both new and old media companies, a change that has drastically altered the definition of a journalist. Secondly, the linked nature of the internet has given rise to content collectors like Google news or The Huffington Post that no longer rely on individual journalists to provide news, but instead depend on their ability to gather and collect information into a single place where users can access it. Together they are changing society’s traditional ideas regarding journalists and news.\n\n\\\\\n**What about us?**\n\nA lot of people at conventions don’t want to talk to the press. But we can’t just shut our doors. So that’s where our team comes in. As a press and media relations volunteer for EF you represent the work of a huge convention, acting as a contact point for members of the press and other media representatives. We want to provide journalists with accurate information and give them a realistic look at our community. The press isn’t good or bad; it’s just the press. We just have to make sure they get right picture and the right story. \nWhen you are part of the media relations team it is important to remember that you represent a whole community. This means that we got a lot of responsibilities. You need to be prepared for the fact that anything you say to a journalist could end up in print or on a website the following day. \nThe job requires you to be flexible, friendly and patient. Sometimes there’s nothing to do, sometimes all journalists arrive at the same time. The job can be stressful so you must be able to work under pressure. The cool thing about working at press relations is that you are also able to show your side of the story. You can influence how the convention looks to the outside world. Also you’re part of a great team full of passionate people. \n\n\\\\\n**Skills**\n\nPress and media relations team members are:\n  * Flexible\n  * Patient\n  * Enthusiastic\n  * Friendly and approachable\n\nJob requirements:\n  * Communication skills\n  * Knows how to deal with criticism\n  * The ability to work under pressure\n  * Passion for our community\n  * Speaking and understanding the German and English language\n\nIf you want to help us, then come to the press & media reception at the convention or write an email to media@eurofurence.org.\n\n\\\\\n**FAQ: How to cooperate with journalists?**\n\n*How much time do journalists have?*\\\\\nJournalists are busy people. They are not here for fun, they are working. They have one goal in mind and that is to write a good story. \n\n*How should I greet the journalists?*\\\\\nFirst impression is everything. Greet them, talk to them and make them feel welcome. Even if you don’t like journalists you should always treat them with respect. They’re human beings just like you and me. \n\n*Are there rules the journalist must follow?*\\\\\nYes! Before you show a journalist around make sure they are well informed about what they can and what they can’t do. They should always first register at the media desk. Here they can get a media badge and the necessary information.\n\n*What if they say something that is not true?*\\\\\nDon’t get angry. Even if they ask difficult questions, you should stay positive. It can be really frustrating when reporters give you the feeling they don’t take you seriously, or if their information is inaccurate. But getting angry only makes it worse. \n\n*But what story should I tell them?*\\\\\nKeep it simple. Most of the time journalists are not interested in all the details you want to tell. Stick to a straight and simple story. There is also a press-release featuring all kinds of background information which journalists can read in their own time if they’re interested. \n\n*Any tips for when they ask me questions?*\\\\\nMake it personal. When you are guiding a journalist they will ask you a lot of questions. Some of them may be difficult to answer. If this happens and you don’t know what to answer just make it personal. Tell your own version of how you see things.\\\\\nBe polite! Even if they aren’t. The best advice is to help journalists as much as possible by giving them (where reasonable) what they ask for. Ensure that your information is relevant to them and provides a good read!\n\n*But what if they ask me difficult questions?*\\\\\nAgain, just stick to your original plan and keep it to yourself. Don’t argue with them because it often makes things worse because most of the time you accidently confirm stories you don’t want to confirm. In the worst scenario you can always just ignore the question.\\\\\nBear in mind, journalists are good at making out they have the entire story already.",

                            "Text": "Calling ourselves the \"Eurofurence Security Crew\", we as a Department of about 75 furries, not few of them professionals in fields like EMS (Emergency Medical Service), the Fire Department or the Police, see the safety and enjoyment of all convention attendees as our ultimate goal. While being responsible as well for security relevant aspects during the Convention preparation, as for security operations during the running Convention, most of you will normally not see or hear much of us, unless it becomes really necessary.\n\nPrior to a Convention, or rather in between two of them, several administrative tasks in preparation fall into our business. These tasks vary from authoring a legal safety concept together with the Eurofurence Paramedic Crew and local safety authorities to advising and supporting other Department directors in regards to fire and safety regulations. During the convention our Security and Paramedic Crew ensures health and safety of all our attendees, while silently enforcing the rules. Those rules are not limited to the RoC (Rules of Conduct) but include venue policies, fire safety, legal regulations, laws and many more. Furthermore we setup and run checkpoints on key areas such as the Art Show or the Campfire.\n\nIn all of our work, we strive to hold up our fundamental rules:\n  * We treat everyone with respect and never forget that we ourselves are members of the furry community\n  * We abide by the law and we do not raise ourselves above others\n  * We condemn intolerance and treat everyone equal\n  * We understand our duty to be a service to all attendees\n  * We set the safety and enjoyment of everyone involved with our convention as our highest goal\n  * We believe in a defensive and emphatic approach to any problem\n  * We strive to always stay fair and unbiased\n\nThe Security Crew is led by the Chief of Security Dhary Montecore and the two vice directors Treyfane Dingo and KittehBit. Together they form the Security Board and are responsible for the organization in advance and hold the final OnSite authority in security matters. Especially qualified Group Leaders manage dedicated Security Groups for their assigned areas such as the Art Show.\n\nThe tactical management on site is carried out 24/7 by a dispatcher, a shift supervisor and an on-duty member of the Security Board. Dispatch also ensures a permanent and direct point of contact for all staff, the hotel and (via dedicated phone lines or exclusive Eurofurence call boxes) all attendees. Check-in of dangerous items and on site volunteer recruitment is handled by the shift supervisor in the OnSite security office. Incident coordination is also the responsibility of the dispatcher, which they carry out following a clear catalog of procedures and an internal alert and response order. The dispatcher is the information and communication backbone for the entire Security Crew.\n\nMembers of the Security Crew are selected for reliability, distinctive social skills, calm demeanour and experience gathered at previous conventions. Their application requirements are the strictest but in return the crew has great team spirit. Ensuring the quality of security service in an environment as dynamic and demanding as a furry convention requires extensive communication skills. The Security Crew is currently able to communicate in more than twelve different languages without external personnel.\n\nSecurity support can be requested from the dispatcher by any Staff Member, telephone (+49 3222 2133812), through any of our CallBoxes (found in various areas of the hotel) or in person in the security office at all times during the convention. Of course female officers are available as well as private meeting rooms for confidential talks.\n\nIn case of any questions before or during the convention, the Security Board will gladly be there to support you. If any advice or assistance regarding security or safety for an event or panel is needed, feel free to contact the Security Board at <security@eurofurence.org>!\n\nWe are constantly open for applications for new Security Crew Members! If you want to contribute in the biggest Team at Eurofurence, feel free to contact us at security_hr@eurofurence.org.",

The Art Show presents exhibits by all manner of artists and facilitates the sales between participating artists, agents and attendees interested in purchasing a piece.\n\nHowever, the Art Show Team does far more than meets the eye: Apart from the regular opening hours of the exhibition, there are setup hours where the panels and tables are prepared, preparation hours where the artists or agents hang their exhibits, accounting hours where the Art Show team enters bids in the database, selling hours where buyers can pick up purchased art, and naturally the famous Stage Auction.\n\nAnd all of this is just done at the con itself - in addition, before the convention we register artists, distribute panels, build new panel hardware, and care for the technical equipment and applications involved in the Show.\n\nThe Art Show handles much of the Charity services too: Charity is partaking in the Auction, has its own panels and tables at the Art Show, and makes use of Art Show database and sales service to get its exhibits processed.\n\n\\\\\nBesides having two Directors to run various aspects of the Show, we employ a small dedicated team of core staffers. The two directors share responsibilities before and during the convention; from the application process through database maintenance and logistics. Each individual team member has their own field of expertise; manning the front desk, handling sales, performing photography, or entering data at the auction.\n\nTo alleviate the huge amount of work which comes with the task of processing over a thousand exhibits, we rely on the help of dedicated volunteers and temporary staff. Much of the work concentrates on certain times: setup, accounting, auction, and sales are the critical crunch times, while the actual opening times do not present a special challenge to the team.\n\nCovering these rush hour work times is only possible by dynamically adapting the team. The runners during the sales are, for example, guest volunteers. Other helpers are borrowed from other departments. But beyond temporary helpers, we are also seeking to expand the permanent core team to meet the coming challenges of a still-growing Art Show, and we're welcoming applicants.\n\n\\\\\nWhat we all share is a dedication for the creative roots of our fandom in both two dimensional picture from and three dimensional sculpt or show piece. We also have some deep rooted connections to our fellow creators who wish to share and show off their pride pieces to the public. Many of us have a background in the arts ourselves, and some of us have remained contributing artists to the community we serve. Thus we can fully empathise with the needs and necessities of both artist and their agents or our clients wanting to buy the piece they have grown to be fond of.\n\nWorking at the Art Show is quite rewarding, as it is a service within the creative heart of the furry idea. Supporting our own talented artists and being able to supply original furry works is what sets our fandom apart from franchise-based fandoms, and we are providing this service with pride.\n\n\\\\\nSkills desired to become an Art Show team member:\n  * Enthusiastic about the arts and craft of our fandom.\n  * Speaking English; knowledge of German highly recommended as much of the team is German-speaking. (Other languages (French, Russian...) are helpful but not a must.)\n  * Able to work concentratedly and cautiously with often fragile exhibits. Willing to learn the Art Show application that is the core of our accounting system. No programming skills needed but welcome if present.\n\nIf you want to be a part of the Art Show Team, then contact: Cairyn via artshow@eurofurence.org or speak to the staff guys in the Art Show during the convention.",

                            "Text": "Eurofurence likes to present itself as a professional convention of friendly, respectful and open-minded members of the furry community and their friends. As a condition of membership, all Eurofurence attendees are required to abide by these rules of conduct for the entire duration of their stay, even prior to opening or after closing of the convention. When in doubt about any of these rules, please ask - we will gladly answer all your questions. However, please understand that we will not debate these rules with you during the convention. The rules of conduct will be strictly enforced by Eurofurence security volunteers who will be clearly identified as such on site. If you have any problem with any action taken by a Staff member you may take the matter up with the Chief of Security or the Chairman.\n\n\n\n**GENERAL RULES**\n\nAny action or behavior that causes significant interference with convention operations, excessive discomfort to other attendees, or adversely affects Eurofurence's relationship with its guests, its venues or the public is strictly forbidden and may result in permanent suspension of membership. This general rule supersedes all others listed below and may be invoked at any time.\n  * Please treat each other respectfully.\n  * You are liable for any damage you might cause.\n  * Always follow the directions by convention staff and security.\n  * Harassment of any kind, including physical assault, battery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome physical attentions, will not be tolerated.\n  * Please be aware that the lobby, the foyers and the restaurants are public areas, and that there may be regular hotel guests around who are not taking part in our convention. Please help us to give them the best possible impression of our fandom!\n\n\n**REGISTRATION AND BADGES**\n  * You must be at least 18 years old on the first day of the convention.\n  * Eurofurence functions are open only to registered attendees.\n  * Attendees are identified by their personal membership badge.\n  * A badge is valid only for the person to whom it was issued and may not be shared.\n  * Badges must be presented and/or surrendered to any Staff member requesting it.\n  * Changing or obscuring information on your badge is not allowed.\n\n\n**HOTEL RULES**\n  * The consumption of food or drink purchased from outside of the hotel is not permitted in the hotel's public areas.\n  * It is strictly forbidden to throw/dangle/hang anything out of any windows, balconies or any other elevated location. Violators will be expelled from the convention.\n  * Attendees may not enter the service areas of the hotel. This includes all backstage areas, service elevators, the rooftops, emergency exits and all areas marked as \"Staff Only\".\n  * Disabling or deliberately triggering fire-protection devices (such as smoke detectors, sprinklers, door alarms) is strictly prohibited.\n  * The sale of any kind of merchandise outside the official Dealers' Den requires explicit permission by the Eurofurence Board of Directors.\n  * No sleeping in the lobby, the hallways or the meeting rooms. Get a room, please!\n  * For safety reasons it is not allowed to bring dogs, cats or other animals into your hotel room or any of the convention event areas.\n\n\n**PARTIES AND GATHERINGS**\n  * Gatherings in hotel rooms must not generate any noise that can be heard in neighboring rooms during nigh-ttime hours.\n  * Hotel doors must be kept shut during such gatherings and guests are not permitted to congregate in the hotel corridors.\n  * Loud parties will be given a single warning to remain quiet. No second warnings will be given before action is taken by the hotel to remove the offending individuals.\n  * All room occupants are equally responsible for cleaning up after a party. Trash must be put into bags. Don't leave the mess for housekeeping.\n  * Security is required to clear out overcrowded rooms. For your own safety we recommend keeping the occupancy below 10 in a regular room, or below 20 in a junior suite.\n\n\n**CLOTHING AND DECENCY**\n\nWearing costumes, accessories or displaying items made out of real fur is not allowed.\nNudity exceeding the equivalent of a non-thong bathing suit is not allowed in public.\nTo prevent damage to costumes and hotel property, body paint requires an individual permission by the Chief of Security. Face make-up does not require permission.\n\nSexual behaviour that goes beyond a mere display of affection is not allowed in public.\nBlatant exposure of fetish gear is not permitted in public, even if it is part of a costume.\nDisplay of adult materials (such as room signs, flyers, business cards, posters and drawings on public message boards) is not permitted in public areas of the hotel and convention center.\nThe limit for \"adult themed\" materials is the equivalent of what you can see on the magazine covers at an average German newsstand. Drawing the line for \"fetish gear\" is a little bit more tricky. To avoid unexpected differences with our Security Staff, please ask us in advance if you're unsure about the adequacy of an item.\nWhen used as a fashion statement or part of a costume, the following items are usually allowed:\n  * Collars (without leash)\n  * Decorative Wristbands (without D-Rings)\n  * Sled Dog Harnesses (only if part of a matching costume)\n\nThe following items are explicitly NOT allowed in public:\n  * Full-body rubber or vinyl costumes.\n  * Costumes that are visibly \"anatomically correct\".\n  * Costumes or accessories related to age-play, pet-play or BDSM.\n  * Costumes indecently revealing the wearers own private anatomy.\n\nWe may take the liberty to allow additional exceptions if your outfit is exceptionally discrete, tasteful and/or good looking - no promise, though.\n\n\n**ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS**\n\nPersons who are intoxicated to the point of incapacity will be escorted to their room, and may consequentially be banned from the convention.\nAny individual found to be in possession of or distributing illegal or controlled substances will be removed and reported directly to the local authorities.\nSmoking is not permitted anywhere inside the hotel and convention center, except for the smoker's lounge.\nYou are expected to drink responsibly. You will be held responsible for what you do, even when drunk.\n\n\n**WEAPONS**\n\nAll weapons, including look-alikes, replicas, tools and toys must be approved immediately after your registration on site. Please go to the ConOps office for approval.\nSecurity may require your weapon to be peace-bound. Tampering with the peace bonding is not allowed.\nNo water pistols, silly string, or any thrown or projectile-type toy may be used in any area of the hotel or convention center.\nMock fights, swordplay, fire breathing or any other dangerous activities are not allowed.\nExceptions for staged events are possible, but require an individual permission by the Chief of Security. Please make sure to inquire ahead of time - preferably before the convention.\n\n\n**PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO**\n\nEurofurence e.V. reserves all rights to video and photo material gathered at the convention with the exception of footage from private rooms.\nEurofurence e.V. grants you the right to use videos and photos you have taken at the convention for private and/or non-commercial purposes.\nPublication in for-profit media requires written permission by the Board of Directors.\nOfficial Eurofurence camera teams may record video and take photos in the public areas of the convention and during events to be used for publication. You agree that videos and pictures taken of you can be used in such publications without release or compensation. A release will only be required for material filmed in situations where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.\nPhotography and filming is strictly forbidden in the Art Show. Cameras and cell phones will have to be left outside.\nOther restrictions or rules may apply for certain events, and will be announced on location.\n\n\n**THE BOTTOM LINE**\n\nThat being said, many of the above rules involve \"worst-case\" scenarios and are put into place to ensure the safety and comfort of our members. In the past, Eurofurence has generally been a quiet and pleasurable experience, and we anticipate no difficulties, as our members as a whole are rational and responsible adults. Eurofurence is prepared to deal with any or all of the above scenarios in a rapid and efficient manner, should they occur. We thank our members for their past cooperation and for their continued assistance in making this a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. Have fun - just please remember to be courteous of those around you while doing so! We hope you will have a great time!",

For your convenience during your stay in the convention center, they also offer a locker service: items that are restricted in the Art Show and Dealers' Den, like cameras or backpacks, will be guarded there for free.\n\nThe Eurofurence Security service has a large team of highly qualified and furry-friendly paramedics on site at all times. They can  take care of anything from a minor scratch to a  life-threatening injury. They have been our  resident crew for many years and have seen everything furries can do to themselves. Don't be shy; they are legally bound to discretion. Please note though, that due to German laws they are not allowed to hand out medication (e.g. painkillers). Contact us if you need any medical support.\n\nWhatever help and support you require, our security service is there for you night and day. Even though some of them might look intimidating with all their equipment, do not forget that they are all furries themselves.
